Default login credentials:
username: username
password: password

Note: You can drag and drop folders in the "upload zone" when clicking on "upload here" button but it won't upload the folder itself, just its contents. The same thing applies for nested folders, you'll just upload the contents of the nested folders, not the folders themselves.

Note: To change the default username and password, you must first sign in with the default credentials (i.e. username = username and password = password) and then click on the "Update login credentials" button.
